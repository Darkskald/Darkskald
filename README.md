## Chemistry ðŸ§ª + coding ðŸ’» = Lab Digital Transformation

I am a physical chemist by training and became a software developer by passion. My goal is to make the best out of both worlds and utilize the power of modern professional software development to ease the life of scientists by automatizing the boring stuff, enabling them to focus on what really matters.

My professional interests:

- device drivers, device remote control
- universal device connectivity protocols (SiLA, OPCUA-LADS)
- interconnection of lab software components (ELN, LIMS, DoE ...)
- integration of the lab-specific software with its digital surrounding in enterprise context (ERP, Workflow Orchestration, User Management...)
- streamlining lab data flows, analyzing and visualizing lab data
